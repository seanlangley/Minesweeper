# Minesweeper
This is an implementation of a basic minesweeper emulator in iOS using the Swift programming language. 
The only testing is done in XCode. 
Further objectives: 
1) When you click an empty space (a space with no adjacent bombs), 
clear all the surrounding redundant empty spaces.
This will most likely be accomplished with recursion. 
2) Use images for squares and bombs rather than [X] and M.
